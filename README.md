We're working on a lot of projects at [TheCodingMachine](https://www.thecodingmachine.com/) and we needed a tool to 
easily start a PHP project with Docker. That's why we started working on the *kickoff-docker-php* stack with the
following goals in mind:

* One project = one technical environment
* A `local` environment as close as possible to our distant environment
* Switching quickly between our projects
* Easy to use

And more! :smiley:

## Install

Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (**>= 17.06**) for your platform.

**Note:** This project won't work using the legacy desktop solution, aka *Docker Toolbox*.

On Linux, you also have to install [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (**>= 1.14.0**) as it does not
come with by default. Also add your current user to the `docker` group and don't forget to logout/login from your current 
session.

Then download and install [Orbit](https://github.com/gulien/orbit) (**>= 2.0.0**), a tool for generating files from templates and 
running commands.

You may now fork this project and clone it or download the latest release from the [releases page](../../releases).

### Optional install for performance gains with Docker Sync (Mac and Windows)

Download and install the latest release of [Docker Sync](http://docker-sync.io/).

**Note:** On Windows, it only works with *Windows Subsystem for Linux*.

## Quick start

Once you've downloaded this project, move to the `config` folder and copy the file `.env.blueprint` and paste it to a file
named `.env`.

| Linux/Mac                	| Windows                    	|
|--------------------------	|----------------------------	|
| `cp .env.blueprint .env` 	| `copy .env.blueprint .env` 	|

**Note:** If you wish to enable Docker Sync, don't forget to set `ENABLE_DOCKER_SYNC` to `true` in your `.env` file.

In the same folder, open the file `project.yml` and set the following variables:

* `virtualhost.local` with your own virtual host
* `name` with your project name

Now open your `hosts` file...
 
| Linux/Mac              | Windows                                                                                             |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sudo nano /etc/hosts` | Run Notepad as administrator and open the file located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`   |
 
...and add the following lines at the end of the file:

```
127.0.0.1   your-virtualhost.local
127.0.0.1   www.your-virtualhost.local
127.0.0.1   traefik.your-virtualhost.local
127.0.0.1   phpadmin.your-virtualhost.local
127.0.0.1   rabbitmq.your-virtualhost.local
127.0.0.1   graylog.your-virtualhost.local
```

**Tip:** Don't want to update your `hosts` file? Set `virtualhost.local` with `your-virtualhost.127.0.0.1.xip.io` 
in your `project.yml` file. Your applications will be available under `*.your-virtualhost.127.0.0.1.xip.io/`!
 
Good :smiley:? We're now done with the configuration! :metal:

Last but not least, move to the root directory, **shutdown your local Apache or anything which could use your 80 
and 443 ports**, and run:

```
orbit run kickoff
```

The installation might take some time, so go for a coffee break! :coffee: 

Once everything has been installed, open your favorite web browser and copy / paste https://www.your-virtualhost.local 
and check if everything is OK!

## Orbit commands

**Note:** You can use the `-d` flag to have a more detailed output.

## Project structure

```
├── config  # Kickoff related configuration files
├── modules # Modules related configuration files
└── app     # The source code of your PHP application
```

Only the configuration files of your modules and the application source code are directly mounted in the containers.
The data of modules like MySQL are stored inside named volumes. You can see those named volumes by running 
`docker volume ls` command. They are named using the project name, your current environment and the considered module.
If you want to locate those volumes on the host, run  `docker inspect {volume name}` command.

**Note:** For now, the credentials will only be set the first time the Graylog, MySQL, RabbitMQ containers are launched. 
If you want to update them after, use the considered dashboard. You could also delete the named volumes, but proceed with 
caution: it will delete all your data.

**Tip:** Your `app` folder should be a git submodule.

## Configuration

| File                 | Description                                                                          |

Don't hesitate to take a look at those files, as they are provided with nice comments!

## Modules

* [Toolbox](#toolbox)
* [Traefik](#traefik)
* [Graylog](#graylog)
* [NGINX](#nginx)
* [PHP-FPM](#php-fpm)
* [MySQL](#mysql)
* [Redis](#redis)
* [RabbitMQ](#rabbitmq)

### Toolbox

The Toolbox is a simple container which is used to:

* Generates the self-signed certificate on your `local` environment
* Generates the `.htdigest` file for authentication to the Traefik dashboard on environments <> `local`
* Generates the SHA2 password and secret pepper for Graylog authentication
* Checks if Graylog is ready to receive logs from others containers
* Checks if others containers have been successfully started

### Traefik

The [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) container is used as a reverse-proxy: it's the entry door which will redirect clients requests
to the correct frontend.

It provides a nice dashboard (https://traefik.your-virtualhost.local/) which requires an authentication on environments <> `local`.

#### HTTPS

On your `local` environment, the Toolbox container will automatically generate a self-signed certificate according to the
virtual host specified in your `project.yml` file.

On others environment, we provided `TRAEFIK_CERT_FILE_PATH` and `TRAEFIK_KEY_FILE_PATH` variables in your `.env` file 
to let you specify the absolute path to your certificates. You may also customize the Traefik configuration located at 
`modules/traefik/traefik.blueprint.toml` with [ACME configuration](https://docs.traefik.io/toml/#acme-lets-encrypt-configuration)
to enable automatic HTTPS. 

#### Configuration

### Graylog

The [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/) containers centralize the Docker's logs of the NGINX, PHP-FPM, MySQL, 
phpMyAdmin, Redis and RabbitMQ containers. It's actually composed of three containers: Elasticsearch, MongoDB
and the Graylog server.

You may access the Graylog dashboard (https://graylog.your-virtualhost.local/) using the credentials provided in your configuration files.

#### Configuration

| Variable                 | Location             | Description                                                                    |

| GRAYLOG_ES_JAVA_OPTS     | `config/.env`        | The Java options for Elasticsearch.                                            |

### NGINX

NGINX is the web server of your PHP application.

The NGINX configuration located at `modules/nginx/conf.d/php-fpm.conf` provides good security defaults. Still, you might 
have to update it according to the PHP framework you wish to use.

Example for a Symfony application: https://gist.github.com/gulien/64d8c94c5d0e294ac121ea810794757e.

### PHP-FPM

The PHP-FPM container has many roles. First, it handles requests from the NGINX container to execute your PHP files.
Then, it provides a complete set of tools to help you building your application. You can run them by connecting to it with
the `orbit run workspace` command.

Your PHP application will be accessible under https://your-virtualhost.local/ and https://www.your-virtualhost.local/.

#### Installed PHP extensions

apcu, bcmath, gd, intl, mbstring, mcrypt, pdo_mysql, phpredis, opcache, soap, xdebug (`local` environment only!), yaml,
zip and more!

You are able to find all installed PHP extensions by running `php -m` inside your workspace.

#### Xdebug

Xdebug is a tool for easily debugging your PHP code. We provided simple variables in your `.env` file as described below.

Example with PhpStorm: https://gist.github.com/gulien/d0933d8f90587a95cec5fd750da41b87.

#### Configuration

| Variable             | Location      | Description                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT     | `config/.env` | Defines the PHP memory limit of the PHP-FPM container.              |

| XDEBUG_ENABLED       | `config/.env` | If true, enables Xdebug.                                            |
| XDEBUG_REMOTE_HOST   | `config/.env` | If Xdebug is enabled, set this variable with your local IP address. |

### MySQL

The MySQL container is the DBMS of this stack.

In your PHP-FPM container, the hostname of the MySQL DBMS is `mysql`. Also, just use the port `3306` and the
credentials defined in the `modules.yml` and `.env` files.

There are also three ways to manage MySQL:

* On `local` environment, you may access the phpMyAdmin dashboard (https://phpadmin.your-virtualhost.local/); 
you will automatically be connected as `root`
* By running `orbit run mysql-cli`: it will open the MySQL cli and connect you as `root`. On environments <> `local`, 
it will ask you the MySQL `root` password
* By mapping the container's port `3306` to a host port, you are able to use a more powerful tool like MySQL Workbench
using `127.0.0.1` (or your server IP) as host and the port defined in the variable `MYSQL_HOST_PORT_TO_MAP` in your
`.env` file

**Note:** On `production` environments, we strongly advise to not put the MySQL port on a public facing port. 
This should be used only in others environments.

### Redis

Redis is the cache store of this stack.

The hostname of Redis in your PHP-FPM container is `redis`. To configure Redis to be the cache handler of 
your PHP application, you should refer to the documentation provided by your PHP framework.

**Note:** You should not use [predis](https://github.com/nrk/predis), as [phpredis](https://github.com/phpredis/phpredis) 
is installed by default.

#### Configuration

| Variable       | Location             | Description                                |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| redis.enable   | `config/modules.yml` | If `true`, enables Redis.                  |
| REDIS_PASSWORD | `.env`               | The auth used to access the Redis DBMS.    |

### RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is the message broker of this stack.

The hostname of RabbitMQ in your PHP-FPM container is `rabbitmq`. To configure RabbitMQ to be the message 
broker of your PHP application, you should refer to the documentation provided by your PHP framework.

You may access the RabbitMQ dashboard (https://rabbitmq.your-virtualhost.local/) using the credentials provided in 
your configuration files.

#### Configuration

| Variable          | Location             | Description                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| rabbitmq.enable   | `config/modules.yml` | If `true`, enables RabbitMQ.                                |
| rabbitmq.user     | `config/modules.yml` | The RabbitMQ user of your PHP application.                  |
| RABBITMQ_PASSWORD | `config/.env`        | The password of the user defined in the `modules.yml` file. |

## Advanced

### Restart strategy

On your `local` environment, your containers will not restart automatically.

On others environments, if you have enable Graylog, they will also not restart automatically. Indeed, we have to check 
that Graylog is ready to receive logs from others containers before we start them. In your production environment, you 
should configure your host to restart in the right order your containers after Docker startup. Indeed, your host provider
might restart your server from time to time. Of course, if Graylog is not enable, your containers have been configured 
to restart automatically. :wink:

### Many environments on the same host

Let's say you want your `staging` and `production` environments to run on the same host. You have cloned two projects,
one per environment.

First, check that you have the same virtual host on both environments. 

Then, start your production environment by running `orbit run kickoff`.

Once done, move to the `staging` environment project folder, and update the following variables in your `.env` file:

* `TRAEFIK_PREFIX` to `true`
* `GRAYLOG_PORT` to another port than the one used by your `production` environment
* If `MYSQL_ENABLE_PORTS_MAPPING=true` on both your environments, update `MYSQL_HOST_PORT_TO_MAP` in your `staging` 
environment to another port than the one used by your `production` environment

**Reminder:** On `production` environments, we strongly advise to not put the MySQL port on a public facing port. 
This should be used only in others environments.

Last but not least, start your `staging` environment by running `orbit run build up`.

**Note:** Don't run `kickoff` command, as we only want one Traefik container! 

If your virtual host is `my-awesome-project.com`, your `production` applications will be available under `*.my-awesome-project.com`
while your `staging` applications will be available under `*-staging.my-awesome-project.com`! :metal:
